This repository contains the final assessment project for UX/UI course from the iOS Developer Professional Certificate by Meta. The project involves designing an intuitive and user-friendly interface for a "Reserve a table" feature. It includes wireframes and a high-fidelity prototype, showcasing my skills in UX/UI design for iOS app development.


### Objectives

- **Design an Intuitive User Interface:** Create a seamless and visually appealing interface that enhances user experience.
- **Develop Wireframes:** Construct initial wireframes to layout the structure and flow of the application.
- **Create a High-Fidelity Prototype:** Build a detailed and interactive prototype to showcase the final design.



### Project Components

1. **Persona:** Detailed descriptions of the target users to guide design decisions.
 
   - **Description:** 
     Personas are fictional characters created based on user research to represent the different user types that might use the application. Each        persona includes details such as demographics, goals, behaviors, and pain points. These personas help in empathizing with users and making         informed design decisions that cater to their needs.


    - **Purpose:** 
     The purpose of creating personas for the Little Lemon restaurant project is to ensure that the "Reserve a table" feature meets the specific        needs of various user types, such as busy professionals, families, and tourists. By understanding the distinct preferences and pain points of      each persona, the design can be tailored to provide a seamless and enjoyable reservation experience. This user-centered approach helps in          aligning the design with real-world scenarios, ensuring the final product is intuitive and valuable for all potential users of the                 restaurant's app.

2. **Journey Map:** Visual representations of the user experience throughout the "Reserve a table" process.
 
   - **Description:** 
     Journey maps are visual representations that outline the steps a user takes to achieve a specific goal within the application. They include        various touchpoints, actions, emotions, and pain points experienced throughout the userâ€™s interaction with the "Reserve a table" feature.          These maps provide a comprehensive view of the user experience from start to finish.


    - **Purpose:** 
     The purpose of creating journey maps for the Little Lemon restaurant project is to identify and address potential pain points and                  opportunities for enhancing the user experience when reserving a table. By mapping out the entire user journey, from discovering the app to        successfully booking a table, designers can ensure that each step is optimized for ease of use and satisfaction. This helps in creating a          smooth, efficient, and pleasant reservation process, ultimately leading to higher user satisfaction and increased likelihood of repeat usage.

3. **Wireframes:** The initial sketches and layouts that map out the structure and navigation of the "Reserve a table" feature.

   - **Description:** 
     Wireframes are low-fidelity visual guides that represent the skeletal framework of the "Reserve a table" feature. They outline the structure,      layout, and basic elements of the application without focusing on design details. The wireframes for the Little Lemon restaurant project           include essential components such as navigation tools, location images, calendar, contact information, and buttons for reserving a table.


   - **Purpose:** 
     The purpose of creating wireframes for the Little Lemon restaurant project is to establish a clear and functional layout for the "Reserve a        table" feature before adding visual design elements. Wireframes help in identifying the placement of key components, ensuring a logical flow       of user interactions, and providing a blueprint for further development. This step is crucial for iterating and refining the user experience,      making it easier to address usability issues early in the design process.

4. **High-Fidelity Prototype:** A polished and interactive version of the design, highlighting the final look and feel of the interface.

   - **Description:** 
     The high-fidelity prototype is a detailed and interactive version of the "Reserve a table" feature, showcasing the final design with               realistic visuals, typography, and interactive elements. This prototype includes comprehensive screens for navigation, reservation details,        contact information, and confirmation, providing a close representation of the end product. The prototype demonstrates the visual aesthetics       and usability of the application, incorporating colors, fonts, and imagery consistent with the Little Lemon brand.
   - **Purpose:** 
     The purpose of creating a high-fidelity prototype for the Little Lemon restaurant project is to provide a realistic and functional model of        the user interface for testing and feedback. This prototype allows stakeholders to experience the look and feel of the application, ensuring       that design choices effectively enhance user engagement and satisfaction. It serves as a vital tool for identifying any final adjustments          needed before development, ensuring that the final product meets both user expectations and business goals.
