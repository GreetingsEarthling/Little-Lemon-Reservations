### Objectives

- **Design an Intuitive User Interface:** Create a seamless and visually appealing interface that enhances user experience.
- **Develop Wireframes:** Construct initial wireframes to layout the structure and flow of the application.
- **Create a High-Fidelity Prototype:** Build a detailed and interactive prototype to showcase the final design.


### Project Components

1. **Persona:** Detailed descriptions of the target users to guide design decisions.
   - **Description:** 
     Personas are fictional characters created based on user research to represent the different user types that might use the application. Each        persona includes details such as demographics, goals, behaviors, and pain points. These personas help in empathizing with users and making         informed design decisions that cater to their needs.
   - **Purpose:** 
      - **Purpose:** 
     The purpose of creating personas for the Little Lemon restaurant project is to ensure that the "Reserve a table" feature meets the specific        needs of various user types, such as busy professionals, families, and tourists. By understanding the distinct preferences and pain points of      each persona, the design can be tailored to provide a seamless and enjoyable reservation experience. This user-centered approach helps in          aligning the design with real-world scenarios, ensuring the final product is intuitive and valuable for all potential users of the                 restaurant's app.
