### Objectives

- **Design an Intuitive User Interface:** Create a seamless and visually appealing interface that enhances user experience.
- **Develop Wireframes:** Construct initial wireframes to layout the structure and flow of the application.
- **Create a High-Fidelity Prototype:** Build a detailed and interactive prototype to showcase the final design.


### Project Components

1. **Persona:** Detailed descriptions of the target users to guide design decisions.
   - **Description:** 
     Personas are fictional characters created based on user research to represent the different user types that might use the application. Each        persona includes details such as demographics, goals, behaviors, and pain points. These personas help in empathizing with users and making         informed design decisions that cater to their needs.
   - **Purpose:** 
     The purpose of creating personas is to ensure that the design process remains user-centered. By understanding the different types of users,        their goals, and challenges, designers can create more tailored and effective user experiences. Personas serve as a reference throughout the       project, helping to align the teamâ€™s understanding of who the users are and what they need from the application.


     

3. **Journey Map:** Visual representations of the user experience throughout the "Reserve a table" process.
4. **Wireframes:** The initial sketches and layouts that map out the structure and navigation of the "Reserve a table" feature.
5. **High-Fidelity Prototype:** A polished and interactive version of the design, highlighting the final look and feel of the interface.


### Learning Outcomes

- **Gained practical experience in UX/UI design tailored for iOS applications.**
- **Developed skills in creating wireframes and high-fidelity prototypes.**
- **Applied design principles to enhance usability and user engagement.**
- **This project exemplifies my ability to integrate user experience design with mobile application development, reflecting the skills acquired through the iOS Developer Professional Certificate by Meta.**
